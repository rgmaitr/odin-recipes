    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p><strong>Apple burgers</strong> consist of patties made with a mixture of <em>pork</em>, <em>beef</em>, and <em>shredded apples</em>. Ingredients added to enhance the flavor are fresh sage, brown sugar, dijon mustard, salt, and pepper. The fresh sage adds a lightness and compliments the fruit throughout the burgers. And the brown sugar adds a little sweetness with dijon for a balanced flavor profile.</p>
